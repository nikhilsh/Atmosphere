Atmosphr's API, Atmosphric, makes it really easy to customize itself to work on-location. It comes with full support for NFC and ad-hoc wifi networks, which are useful for indoor locations with weak reception, or users with limited mobile data.

Check out Singapore History Consultant's work on using Atmosphric to augment visitors' experience to Battle Box in Fort Canning!

Wifi access points are stategically placed in each war room of the Battle Box to serve assets. When visitors visit each room, they can use Atmosphr via NFC to experience the war room as it was back in 1942.
