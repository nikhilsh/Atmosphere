Atmosphr's API makes it really easy to customize itself to work on-location. It comes with full support for iBeacons, and even some nifty features such as ad-hoc wifi networks, which come in really handy for indoor locations with weak reception, or users with limited mobile data.

Check out Singapore History Consultant's work on using Atmosphr to augment visitors' experience to Battle Box in Fort Canning!

We enhanced Battle Box by strategically placing iBeacons in each war room of the Battle Box. When visitors visit each room, they can use Atmosphr to connect to the ad-hoc wifi network and experience the war room as it was back in 1942.
