Atmosphr is supported by Singapore Tourism Board's official panorama library, but to make the possibilities truly endless, Atmosphr also supports user-submitted panoramas.

To submit a panorama, simply drag it into the cloud above!

We use and recommend Google's [Photo Sphere](https://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/) app.
